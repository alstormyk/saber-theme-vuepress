## Saber and Markdown Plugins included

### Saber

- `saber-plugin-query-posts`: Inject `posts` to homepage's `page` prop, generate tag pages

### Markdown

- `markdown-it-div`
With this plugin you can create block divs like:
```

</div>
```
Vuepress styling is set up for tip, warning, and danger divs.

*danger*
:::

## Table of Contents
Table of contents is provided by [![TocBot](https://tscanlin.github.io/tocbot)](https://tscanlin.github.io/tocbot). This works with markdown and vue. Heading id's are automatically done in markdown. Heading id's need to be added when using vue.
